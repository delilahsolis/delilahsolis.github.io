        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a curious soul with a deep-rooted passion for 
        uncovering and preserving the narratives that shape our collective history.
        My journey into the world of archival research and public history has been
        nothing short of enlightening, fueled by a relentless pursuit of knowledge
        and a genuine desire to contribute meaningfully to the preservation of our
        cultural heritage.

<br><br>

        With a diligent approach and an unwavering commitment to excellence, I have
        ventured into various realms of professional experience that have sculpted
        my understanding of the intricate tapestry of historical preservation. 
        From my role as a Public History Intern at A Peopleâ€™s History of the IE,
        I delved into the meticulous process of transcribing oral histories and 
        creating metadata for digitized images, all while immersing myself in the 
        rich narratives of the Inland Empire. This experience not only honed my 
        archival skills but also instilled in me a profound appreciation for the 
        power of storytelling in shaping our understanding of the past. Similarly,
        my tenure at the City of Corona Public Library offered me invaluable hands
        -on experience in archival management, where I learned the importance of
        adhering to archival description standards and creating comprehensive catalogs 
        to facilitate collection discovery. Through these experiences, I developed
        a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of the ethical responsibilities
        inherent in preserving historical materials for future generations.
<br><br>

        Beyond the realm of archival work, my role as a House Manager at Starlight 
        Cinemas has provided me with a unique blend of customer service expertise 
        and operational management skills. From overseeing guest payments to managing
        clerical tasks, I have cultivated a versatile skill set that complements 
        my passion for historical preservation. My ability to navigate digital 
        tools and software with ease has allowed me to streamline processes and 
        enhance the overall guest experience, underscoring my commitment to excellence
        in every endeavor.
<br><br>
        In addition to my professional experiences, my academic journey has served 
        as a cornerstone of my growth and development. Currently pursuing a Bachelor 
        of Arts in History at the University of California, Riverside, I have
        consistently excelled academically, earning a place on the Deanâ€™s List 
        and maintaining a GPA of 3.90. My time at Palomar College further solidified 
        my passion for history, earning an Associates of Arts degree while also being 
        recognized on the Deanâ€™s List for my academic achievements.Furthermore, my 
        time spent at both University of California, Riverside and Palomar College 
        has not only enriched my academic knowledge but has also fostered a sense of 
        intellectual curiosity and a dedication to lifelong learning. Engaging in 
        stimulating discussions with peers and professors, I have broadened my 
        perspectives and deepened my understanding of historical narratives across 
        diverse cultures and time periods. These academic experiences have not only e
        quipped me with a robust foundation in historical research methodologies but 
        have also instilled in me a sense of responsibility to contribute meaningfully 
        to the scholarly discourse in the field of history.
<br><br>
        As I look towards the future, I am excited about the possibilities that 
        lie ahead in the dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of archival research 
        and public history. With a blend of academic excellence, practical experience,
        and a genuine passion for preserving our cultural heritage, I am confident
        in my ability to make meaningful contributions to the field and leave a 
        lasting impact on future generations.
